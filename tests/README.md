## mdt

[Directions on how to use the mdt tool](https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board/mdt/#install-mdt)

- Disconnect the network and connect the USB. 
- This will allow you to connect to the board over serial
- Note that not all USB C cables will do data AND power (some just do power) so be sure to check `dmesg`

```sh
mdt shell
```
